### ✅ How to Customize

- Replace feature list with actual modules you’ve implemented.
- Confirm file names and directory layout exactly match your repo.
- Add badges (build status, PyPI, coverage) if available.
- Link to live demos, video tutorials, or hosted notebooks if you maintain them.

Let me know if you'd like help adding badges, example visuals, or polish for the automatic table of contents!
